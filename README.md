This python library help generate the **TéléTD files** for the french fiscal administration, which include **DAS2**, also called *Déclaration d'honoraires*. It is used by the OCA module l10n\_fr\_das2 from [OCA/l10n-france](https://github.com/OCA/l10n-france).

The French fiscal administration updates the encryption keys for DAS2 files every year. The encryption keys are updated in this module, which avoids updating the OCA module l10n\_fr\_das2 for every Odoo version. The specifications of the DAS2 file and the encryption keys are available on [www.impots.gouv.fr/tiers-declarants-0](https://www.impots.gouv.fr/tiers-declarants-0).
